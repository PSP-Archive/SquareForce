Three centuries ago, Humanity realised the most important invention of the history by creating an electronic device with similar properties to organic cells. This device, composed of thousands nanomachines, was able to take wathever form and functionnality once programmed. It had then the ability to regenerate itself if damaged. Finally it was able to interface directly with some other devices of this type by understanding the functionality of each other device.
They named this device "SquareTile".

Some months after this unprecedented invention, the army grabbed the SquareTile technology for a secret programm. The idea was to create an autonomous tactical unite capable of defeating whatever army by itself. The prototype was equipped with an new experimental AI that was able to decide by itself the best option in case of conflict.
The codename "SquareMaster" was given to this prototype.

This day is known as the last day of peace in the world.
At the time some scientists proclaimed that the SquareMaster had determined that the SquareTile was the ultimate evolution of living organism since it was superior in all aspects. Some others hypothesized that a bug had occured in the SquareMaster's software and had altered the data relative to the three laws of robotics defined some centuries ago. The last ones assured some extremists would have infected the SquareMaster with a virus making it out of control.

The only established fact is that the SquareMaster simply decided to eradicate any trace of living organism to the ends of the kwown and unknown universe. The only survivors of this genocide were those who leaved the Earth aboard spaceships, hoping to find a new host planet.

This fateful day is known as the "WIPE" day.


We are in the third century after the WIPE. The universe is almost under total control of this cyber entity called the SquareMaster. Humanity already weakened and is on the verge of extinction, shortly wiped out by its own technology. 
Exiled survivors are scattered to the four corners of the galaxy. Some have found a new host planet on which to rebuild their lives, others still roam in space. However all live in the same obsession that one day appears the troops of the SquareMaster. 
Their only weapon is the same as their worst enemy : the SquareTile. 


The battle between Organics and Cybernetics is about to end. Can you change the destiny of mankind?
